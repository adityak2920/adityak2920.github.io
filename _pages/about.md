Hi, I'm Aditya. I am an undergraduate learning and exploring the applications of deep learning. Right now, I am working as a Research Intern at 
[Retail Pulse](http://retailpulse.ai/) where, I'm solving problems faced by FMCG, CPG companies and retailers using deep learning and computer vision. I have in the 
past worked on different applications of deep learning like self-supervised steel pouring classification in steel manufaturing process for 
[Sparrosense](https://www.sparrosense.com/) and automating car insurance claims using deep learning and computer vision for [Humonics Global](http://humonics.ai/).
I have worked with [Humonics Global](http://humonics.ai/) on project from research to production phase. I have mostly worked on object detection, instance 
segmentation and classfication. 

Right now, I am focusing on training computer vision models with less amount of data. Basically, I am focusing on unsupervised representation learning for computer
vision. I like to read papers, find takeways from the paper and then implement the paper in my own way. I also sometimes participate in Kaggle competitions. I am 
always looking to learn new things. So, these days I am learning about maths and theory behind different NLP concepts. I like to read blogs about different 
innovative applications of deep learning to solve real world problems. I also like to solve data structures and algorithms problems and sometimes participate in 
competitions because ranks in these competitions really motivates me.

In my free time, I like to watch crime thrillers. I also contribute and answers to questions of others on reddit or different forums because these forums or 
communities have solved my problems also. I am firm beleiver that with hardwork anyone can achieve anything. I beleive in code first approach but at the same time I 
also like to read and learn about theory and mathematics behind different concepts.

### Open Source
I am an open source contributor of OpenCV.
